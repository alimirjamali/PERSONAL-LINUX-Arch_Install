# Tools, Configs, Customization & Tweaks for Archlinux
This repository is from my early days of Archlinux. While I was getting used to
this Distro.

## My personal installation scripts for Arch Linux
A simple bash script with the list of packages to be installed during the
initial pacstap transaction. This is really old and obsolete. It is necessary to
switch to a modern cross-platform approach.

## Themes
#### GRUB
I was using a 
[modified Vimix](https://github.com/vinceliuice/grub2-themes/tree/master/grub-theme-vimix/Vimix/icons) 
theme for 
[GRUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB/Tips_and_tricks#Theme).
I planned to fork the mentioned theme and add custom ICONs for shutdown, reboot 
and reboot to firmware. A custom GRUB menu file is added to repo.

#### Plymouth
[Plymouth](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/plymouth) is installed via AUR.
I was using the solar theme.

#### SDDM
I was using breeze theme for SDDM.
